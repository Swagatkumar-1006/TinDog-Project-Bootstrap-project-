It seems like the code for your HTML page got cut off at the end. From the current content, you're building a website for "TinDog," which is likely a parody of dating apps, aimed at dogs. Here's a brief overview of the sections of your website:

Title Section:

The main heading invites users to "Meet new and interesting dogs nearby."
There are buttons to download the app, either via Apple or Google Play.
Features Section:

Lists three key selling points: ease of use, an elite clientele, and guaranteed results.
Each feature is paired with an icon and a short description.
Testimonial Section:

A playful testimonial from a fictional dog, Pebbles from New York, accompanied by a dog image.
Logos of media outlets like TechCrunch, Mashable, and others are displayed below the testimonial.
Pricing Section:

Three different pricing plans named after dog breeds (Chihuahua, Labrador, and Mastiff).
The plans range from a free tier with limited matches/messages to premium plans offering more features.
